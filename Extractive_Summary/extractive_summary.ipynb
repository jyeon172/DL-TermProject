맨체스터 유나이티드가 가까워지고 있는 가운데, 아스널도 김민재 영입전에 참전했다.\n","\n","\n","\n","김민재의 주가가 나날이 치솟고 있다. 지난 여름 1,805만 유로(약 257억 원)의 금액으로 나폴리의 유니폼을 입은 그는 적응기 없이 팀의 수비벽을 견고하게 만들었다.\n","\n","\n","\n","새로운 역사의 주인공이 됐다. 나폴리는 김민재의 활약에 힘입어 라이벌들을 압도하며 33년 만의 스쿠데토를 차지하는 쾌거를 이뤄냈다. 또한 유럽축구연맹(UEFA) 챔피언스리그(UCL)에서도 사상 처음으로 8강에 진출하며 아름다운 시즌을 장식했다.\n","\n","\n","\n","수많은 클럽이 김민재를 주시하고 있다. 맨유, 리버풀, 파리 생제르맹(PSG) 등 센터백 보강을 필요로 하는 구단이라면 한 번 쯤 김민재와 연결됐다. 세리에A를 호령한 센터백에게 5,000만 유로(약 713억 원)를 전후하는 바이아웃은 저렴하게 보일 정도다.\n","\n","\n","\n","가장 깊게 엮인 팀은 맨유다. 이미 '키스 키스 나폴리', '일 마티노' 등 유수의 나폴리 현지 매체들은 맨유가 김민재와 협상을 진행하고 있으며, 김민재가 이번 여름 나폴리를 떠날 것이라 예측했다.\n","\n","\n","\n","이유는 충분하다. 맨유는 올 시즌 라파엘 바란과 리산드로 마르티네스의 강력한 중앙수비 조합을 구축했다. 그러나 이 둘이 빠졌을 때 후방 안정화에 실패하며 굴곡을 겪기도 했다. 바란의 나이가 30세로 적지 않고 부상도 잦아지고 있어 그의 잠재적인 대체자도 필요한 상황이다.\n","\n","\n","\n","이적 전문가도 김민재의 맨유행을 점쳤다. 유럽축구 이적시장에 정통한 파브리시오 로마노 기자는 \"맨유는 김민재에게 정말로 관심이 있다. 11월부터 접촉해왔다. 하지만 맨유도 지금 바로 바이아웃을 발동할 수는 없다\"라며 맨유가 7월이 되자마자 방출 조항을 통해 김민재를 데려올 것이라 내다봤다.\n","\n","\n","\n","영국 '더 선'은 이 모든 보도를 종합해 26일(이하 한국시간) \"맨유가 김민재 영입에 임박했다. 오는 7월 활성화 될 4,000만 파운드(약 657억 원)의 바이아웃을 지불할 용의가 있다\"라며 김민재가 에릭 텐 하흐 감독의 주요 타깃이라고 전했다.\n","\n","\n","\n","영국 '미러' 역시 \"김민재가 맨유와의 이적 합의에 임박했다. 맨유는 올드 트래포드 입성을 준비하고 있다는 암시를 남긴 나폴리의 수비수 김민재와 계약하기로 합의했다\"라고 언급했다.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","여기에 아스널이 끼어들었다. 아스널은 이번 시즌 윌리엄 살리바와 가브리엘 마갈량이스의 활약 속에 치열한 우승 경쟁을 펼쳤다. 그러나 살리바의 부상을 기점으로 팀이 흔들리기 시작했고, 결국 맨체스터 시티에 정상을 내주며 19년 만의 우승의 꿈을 접어야 했다.\n","\n","\n","\n","확실한 센터백 보강으로 다음 시즌을 노리겠다는 심산이다. 영국 '익스프레스'는 26일 \"나폴리가 두려워하는 '최고의 센터백' 김민재를 향한 아스널과 맨유의 전투가 발발했다. 아스널은 김민재를 이상적인 보강으로 고려하고 있다\"라며 아스널이 김민재 영입에 뛰어들었다고 전했다.\n","\n","\n","\n","마침 중앙수비 자원도 매물로 내놓을 계획이다. 영국 '더 부트 룸'은 26일 \"아스널은 롭 홀딩을 대체할 선수로 김민재를 선택했다\"라고 전했다. 홀딩은 2016년부터 아스널에서 뛰어왔으나, 잦은 부상과 선발 자원으로서의 부족함 등으로 한계를 드러낸 선수다.\n","\n","\n","\n","김민재에 대한 잉글랜드의 관심이 점차 고조되고 있다. 맨유행이 유력했던 가운데 UCL에 진출한 또 다른 클럽 아스널이 참전하면서 김민재를 둘러싼 이적시장의 열기를 달구고 있다.\n","Downloading (…)solve/main/vocab.txt: 100% 248k/248k [00:00<00:00,
